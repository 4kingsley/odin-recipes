    <h2>
        Spaghettini with Mushrooms, Garlic, and Oil
    </h2>
    <p>This rich meal is an easy upgrade to busy weeknights thanks to store-bought cheese tortellini. Egg yolks aren’t traditional in Alfredo sauce recipes, but they’re key to this version’s extra silky and luscious texture; generous lemon zest, black pepper, and fresh herbs cut through the richness. Use any kind of tortellini that you like, or use a store-bought rotisserie chicken to make this recipe even easier.</p>
        <!--ingredients-->
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for cooking water</li>

        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper, divided</li>
        <li>4 1/2 ounces Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, finely grated (about 1 cup)</li>
        <li>1 (15-ounce) container whole-milk ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 ounce Parmesan cheese, grated (1 cup)</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 (9-ounce) packages refrigerated three-cheese tortellini (such as Buitoni)</li>
    </ul>
    <!--steps to follow-->
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high; season generously with salt. Add tortellini, and cook for 1 minute less than package directions, about 4 minutes. Remove 1 cup cooking water from pot, and set aside; drain remaining water. Set tortellini aside.</li>
        <li>Place egg yolks in a medium bowl; add 3/4 teaspoon salt, and whisk to loosen. Set aside. Melt butter in a large high-sided skillet over medium. Add garlic, and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add cream, and bring to a simmer over medium. Reduce heat to medium-low. Using a large spoon in one hand and a whisk in other hand, add some of simmering cream to egg yolk mixture, and whisk constantly to temper eggs. Add another spoonful of hot cream to egg mixture, and continue to whisk constantly. Repeat process until eggs are liquidy and bowl is hot. Add egg mixture to skillet with remaining cream mixture. Cook over medium, stirring often, until thickened, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low, and whisk in cheese, about 1/4 cup at a time, until smooth, about 5 minutes.        </li>
        <li>Cook lasagna noodles according to package instructions in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until al dente. Drain noodles, and rinse under cold water. Dry noodles between layers of paper towels.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F. Spread 3/4 cup Mornay Sauce in the bottom of a 13- x 9-inch metal pan or ceramic baking dish. Top with 3 noodles. Spread 1 cup of Spinach Ricotta over the noodles; top with 1/2 cup of the reserved spinach mixture, 1 cup mozzarella, and 3/4 cup Mornay Sauce. Repeat the layering process 2 times. Top with remaining 3 noodles, 1 cup Mornay Sauce, and 1 cup mozzarella. Cover with aluminum foil coated with cooking spray to avoid the cheese sticking. Bake for 30 minutes. Remove foil, and continue bake until the lasagna is bubbling along edges and a crust starts to form on top, about 15 minutes. Increase oven temperature to broil (do not remove lasagna from oven); broil until cheese is browned and bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from oven, and let stand 30 minutes before serving.</li>
