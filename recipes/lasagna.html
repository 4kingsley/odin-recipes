            World's Best Lasagna
        </h2>
    <p>
        There are many iterations of spinach lasagna but this one is our favorite because of its simplicity and its generous use of cheese. While decadent, the spinach is a nice foil to all the richness, and even makes getting your vegetables seem easier than ever. To get the best spinach flavor, this recipe calls for a sautéed fresh spinach that’s whirled with ricotta and Parmesan before being tucked into layers of noodles. Be sure to squeeze the spinach as dry as possible to get the best lasagna texture.</p>

        </ul>
    <!--steps to follow-->
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a large deep-sided skillet over medium-high. Add onion, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper; cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 4 minutes. Add spinach, a few handfuls at a time, and cook, stirring often, until all spinach is wilted, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a mesh strainer, and press spinach to remove as much liquid as possible. Set aside 1 1/2 cups spinach mixture. Transfer remaining 1 cup spinach mixture to a food processor; pulse until finely chopped, 8 to 10 pulses. Transfer finely chopped spinach to a large bowl. Add ricotta, Parmesan, egg, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper; fold until well combined (makes 3 cups). Set aside.</li>
            <li>Wipe large deep-sided skillet clean; add butter, and heat over medium. Add garlic; cook, stirring occasionally, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add flour, and cook, stirring constantly, until roux is light golden, about 1 minute. Gradually whisk in milk, and bring to a simmer over medium; simmer, stirring often, until sauce thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 3 minutes. Gradually whisk in Gruyère cheese until fully melted and smooth. Remove from heat, and stir in salt and nutmeg.</li>
            <li>Cook lasagna noodles according to package instructions in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until al dente. Drain noodles, and rinse under cold water. Dry noodles between layers of paper towels.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350°F. Spread 3/4 cup Mornay Sauce in the bottom of a 13- x 9-inch metal pan or ceramic baking dish. Top with 3 noodles. Spread 1 cup of Spinach Ricotta over the noodles; top with 1/2 cup of the reserved spinach mixture, 1 cup mozzarella, and 3/4 cup Mornay Sauce. Repeat the layering process 2 times. Top with remaining 3 noodles, 1 cup Mornay Sauce, and 1 cup mozzarella. Cover with aluminum foil coated with cooking spray to avoid the cheese sticking. Bake for 30 minutes. Remove foil, and continue bake until the lasagna is bubbling along edges and a crust starts to form on top, about 15 minutes. Increase oven temperature to broil (do not remove lasagna from oven); broil until cheese is browned and bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from oven, and let stand 30 minutes before serving.</li>
